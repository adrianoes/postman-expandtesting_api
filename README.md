# Tests:

- Load expandtesting.json and expandtesting_env.json files on Postman and send the requests.
- Execute ```newman run ./expandtesting.json -g ./expandtesting_env.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export ./results/report.html``` to run the collection via command line and store the report inside results folder inside project directory.
- Execute ```newman run ./expandtesting.json -g ./expandtesting_env.json``` to run the collection via command line and have the results on terminal.

# Tips:

- UI and API tests to send password reset link to user's email and API tests to verify a password reset token and reset a user's password must be tested manually as they rely on e-mail verification.
